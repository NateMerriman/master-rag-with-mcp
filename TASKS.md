## Discovered Issues / Notes

### Task 1.0 - Performance Baseline Issues Resolved
- **Environment Configuration**: Original .env used `host.docker.internal:54321` for Docker networking with n8n, but local testing required `localhost:54321`. Fixed with temporary override in test scripts.
- **Supabase Client Edge Function Issue**: Python supabase client had compatibility issues with edge function calls, returning "Unexpected end of JSON input". Fixed by implementing direct requests approach.
- **Empty Search Results**: Initial baseline capture returned 0 results due to edge function issues. After fixing search function, captured real baseline with 10 results per query.
- **Performance Variation**: Search response times vary (25-50%) between runs, which is normal for hybrid search operations.
