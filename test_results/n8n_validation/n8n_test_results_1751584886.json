They use large language models (LLMs) to interpret user input and make decisions about how to best process requests using the information and resources they have available.\n#### AI chain[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-chain> \"Permanent link\")\nAI chains allow you to interact with large language models (LLMs) and other resources in sequences of calls to components. AI chains in n8n don't use persistent memory, so you can't use them to reference previous context (use AI agents for this).\n#### AI embedding[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-embedding> \"Permanent link\")\nEmbeddings are numerical representations of data using vectors. They're used by AI to interpret complex data and relationships by mapping values across many dimensions. Vector databases, or vector stores, are databases designed to store and access embeddings.\n#### AI groundedness[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-groundedness> \"Permanent link\")\nIn AI, and specifically in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) contexts, groundedness and ungroundedness are measures of how much a model's responses accurately reflect source information. The model uses its source documents to generate grounded responses, while ungrounded responses involve speculation or hallucination unsupported by those same sources.\n#### AI reranking[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-reranking> \"Permanent link\")\nReranking is a technique that refines the order of a list of candidate documents to improve the relevance of search results. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and other applications use reranking to prioritize the most relevant information for generation or downstream tasks.\n#### AI memory[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-memory> \"Permanent link\")\nIn an AI context, memory allows AI tools to persist message context across interactions. This allows you to have a continuing conversations with AI agents, for example, without submitting ongoing context with each message. In n8n, AI agent nodes can use memory, but AI chains can't.\n#### AI retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag> \"Permanent link\")\nRetrieval-augmented generation, or RAG, is a technique for providing LLMs access to new information from external sources to improve AI responses. RAG systems retrieve relevant documents to ground responses in up-to-date, domain-specific, or proprietary knowledge to supplement their original training data. RAG systems often rely on vector stores to manage and search this external data efficiently.\n#### AI tool[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-tool> \"Permanent link\")\nIn an AI context, a tool is an add-on resource that the AI can refer to for specific information or functionality when responding to a request. The AI model can use a tool to interact with external systems or complete specific, focused tasks.\n#### AI vector store[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-vector-store> \"Permanent link\")\nVector stores, or vector databases, are databases designed to store numerical representations of information called embeddings.\n#### API[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#api> \"Permanent link\")\nAPIs, or application programming interfaces, offer programmatic access to a service's data and functionality. APIs make it easier for software to interact with external systems. They're often offered as an alternative to traditional user-focused interfaces accessed through web browsers or UI.\n#### canvas (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#canvas-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nThe canvas is the main interface for building workflows in n8n's editor UI. You use the canvas to add and connect nodes to compose workflows.\n#### cluster node (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#cluster-node-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nIn n8n, cluster nodes are groups of nodes that work together to provide functionality in a workflow. They consist of a root node and one or more sub nodes that extend the node's functionality.\n#### credential (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#credential-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nIn n8n, credentials store authentication information to connect with specific apps and services. After creating credentials with your authentication information (username and password, API key, OAuth secrets, etc.), you can use the associated app node to interact with the service.\n#### data pinning (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#data-pinning-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nData pinning allows you to temporarily freeze the output data of a node during workflow development. This allows you to develop workflows with predictable data without making repeated requests to external services. Production workflows ignore pinned data and request new data on each execution.\n#### editor (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#editor-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nThe n8n editor UI allows you to create and manage workflows. The main area is the canvas, where you can compose workflows by adding, configuring, and connecting nodes. The side and top panels allow you to access other areas of the UI like credentials, templates, variables, executions, and more.\n#### entitlement (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#entitlement-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nIn n8n, entitlements grant n8n instances access to plan-restricted features for a specific period of time.\nFloating entitlements are a pool of entitlements that you can distribute among various n8n instances. You can re-assign a floating entitlement to transfer its access to a different n8n instance.\n#### evaluation (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#evaluation-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nIn n8n, evaluation allows you to tag and organize execution history and compare it against new executions. You can use this to understand how your workflow performs over time as you make changes. In particular, this is useful while developing AI-centered workflows.\n#### expression (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#expression-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nIn n8n, expressions allow you to populate node parameters dynamically by executing JavaScript code. Instead of providing a static value, you can use the n8n expression syntax to define the value using data from previous nodes, other workflows, or your n8n environment.\n#### LangChain[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#langchain> \"Permanent link\")\nLangChain is an AI-development framework used to work with large language models (LLMs). LangChain provides a standardized system for working with a wide variety of models and other resources and linking different components together to build complex applications.\n#### Large language model (LLM)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#large-language-model-llm> \"Permanent link\")\nLarge language models, or LLMs, are AI machine learning models designed to excel in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. They're built by training on large amounts of data to develop probabilistic models of language and other data.\n#### node (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#node-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nIn n8n, nodes are individual components that you compose to create workflows. Nodes define when the workflow should run, allow you to fetch, send, and process data, can define flow control logic, and connect with external services.\n#### project (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#project-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nn8n projects allow you to separate workflows, variables, and credentials into separate groups for easier management. Projects make it easier for teams to collaborate by sharing and compartmentalizing related resources.\n#### root node (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#root-node-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nEach n8n cluster node contains a single root nodes that defines the main functionality of the cluster. One or more sub nodes attach to the root node to extend its functionality.\n#### sub node (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#sub-node-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nn8n cluster nodes consist of one or more sub nodes connected to a root node. Sub nodes extend the functionality of the root node, providing access to specific services or resources or offering specific types of dedicated processing, like calculator functionality, for example.\n#### template (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#template-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nn8n templates are pre-built workflows designed by n8n and community members that you can import into your n8n instance. When using templates, you may need to fill in credentials and adjust the configuration to suit your needs.\n#### trigger node (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#trigger-node-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nA trigger node is a special node responsible for executing the workflow in response to certain conditions. All production workflows need at least one trigger to determine when the workflow should run.\n#### workflow (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#workflow-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nAn n8n workflow is a collection of nodes that automate a process. Workflows begin execution when a trigger condition occurs and execute sequentially to achieve complex tasks.\nWas this page helpful? \nThanks for your feedback! \nThanks for your feedback!

      "markdown": "# Glossary\n#### AI agent[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-agent> \"Permanent link\")\nAI agents are artificial intelligence systems capable of responding to requests, making decisions, and performing real-world tasks for users. They use large language models (LLMs) to interpret user input and make decisions about how to best process requests using the information and resources they have available.\n#### AI chain[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-chain> \"Permanent link\")\nAI chains allow you to interact with large language models (LLMs) and other resources in sequences of calls to components. AI chains in n8n don't use persistent memory, so you can't use them to reference previous context (use AI agents for this).\n#### AI embedding[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-embedding> \"Permanent link\")\nEmbeddings are numerical representations of data using vectors. They're used by AI to interpret complex data and relationships by mapping values across many dimensions. Vector databases, or vector stores, are databases designed to store and access embeddings.\n#### AI groundedness[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-groundedness> \"Permanent link\")\nIn AI, and specifically in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) contexts, groundedness and ungroundedness are measures of how much a model's responses accurately reflect source information. The model uses its source documents to generate grounded responses, while ungrounded responses involve speculation or hallucination unsupported by those same sources.\n#### AI reranking[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-reranking> \"Permanent link\")\nReranking is a technique that refines the order of a list of candidate documents to improve the relevance of search results. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and other applications use reranking to prioritize the most relevant information for generation or downstream tasks.\n#### AI memory[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-memory> \"Permanent link\")\nIn an AI context, memory allows AI tools to persist message context across interactions. This allows you to have a continuing conversations with AI agents, for example, without submitting ongoing context with each message. In n8n, AI agent nodes can use memory, but AI chains can't.\n#### AI retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag> \"Permanent link\")\nRetrieval-augmented generation, or RAG, is a technique for providing LLMs access to new information from external sources to improve AI responses. RAG systems retrieve relevant documents to ground responses in up-to-date, domain-specific, or proprietary knowledge to supplement their original training data. RAG systems often rely on vector stores to manage and search this external data efficiently.\n#### AI tool[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-tool> \"Permanent link\")\nIn an AI context, a tool is an add-on resource that the AI can refer to for specific information or functionality when responding to a request. The AI model can use a tool to interact with external systems or complete specific, focused tasks.\n#### AI vector store[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-vector-store> \"Permanent link\")\nVector stores, or vector databases, are databases designed to store numerical representations of information called embeddings.\n#### API[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#api> \"Permanent link\")\nAPIs, or application programming interfaces, offer programmatic access to a service's data and functionality. APIs make it easier for software to interact with external systems. They're often offered as an alternative to traditional user-focused interfaces accessed through web browsers or UI.\n#### canvas (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#canvas-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nThe canvas is the main interface for building workflows in n8n's editor UI. You use the canvas to add and connect nodes to compose workflows.\n#### cluster node (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#cluster-node-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nIn n8n, cluster nodes are groups of nodes that work together to provide functionality in a workflow. They consist of a root node and one or more sub nodes that extend the node's functionality.\n#### credential (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#credential-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nIn n8n, credentials store authentication information to connect with specific apps and services. After creating credentials with your authentication information (username and password, API key, OAuth secrets, etc.), you can use the associated app node to interact with the service.\n#### data pinning (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#data-pinning-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nData pinning allows you to temporarily freeze the output data of a node during workflow development. This allows you to develop workflows with predictable data without making repeated requests to external services. Production workflows ignore pinned data and request new data on each execution.\n#### editor (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#editor-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nThe n8n editor UI allows you to create and manage workflows. The main area is the canvas, where you can compose workflows by adding, configuring, and connecting nodes. The side and top panels allow you to access other areas of the UI like credentials, templates, variables, executions, and more.\n#### entitlement (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#entitlement-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nIn n8n, entitlements grant n8n instances access to plan-restricted features for a specific period of time.\nFloating entitlements are a pool of entitlements that you can distribute among various n8n instances. You can re-assign a floating entitlement to transfer its access to a different n8n instance.\n#### evaluation (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#evaluation-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nIn n8n, evaluation allows you to tag and organize execution history and compare it against new executions. You can use this to understand how your workflow performs over time as you make changes. In particular, this is useful while developing AI-centered workflows.\n#### expression (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#expression-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nIn n8n, expressions allow you to populate node parameters dynamically by executing JavaScript code. Instead of providing a static value, you can use the n8n expression syntax to define the value using data from previous nodes, other workflows, or your n8n environment.\n#### LangChain[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#langchain> \"Permanent link\")\nLangChain is an AI-development framework used to work with large language models (LLMs). LangChain provides a standardized system for working with a wide variety of models and other resources and linking different components together to build complex applications.\n#### Large language model (LLM)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#large-language-model-llm> \"Permanent link\")\nLarge language models, or LLMs, are AI machine learning models designed to excel in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. They're built by training on large amounts of data to develop probabilistic models of language and other data.\n#### node (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#node-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nIn n8n, nodes are individual components that you compose to create workflows. Nodes define when the workflow should run, allow you to fetch, send, and process data, can define flow control logic, and connect with external services.\n#### project (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#project-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nn8n projects allow you to separate workflows, variables, and credentials into separate groups for easier management. Projects make it easier for teams to collaborate by sharing and compartmentalizing related resources.\n#### root node (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#root-node-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nEach n8n cluster node contains a single root nodes that defines the main functionality of the cluster. One or more sub nodes attach to the root node to extend its functionality.\n#### sub node (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#sub-node-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nn8n cluster nodes consist of one or more sub nodes connected to a root node. Sub nodes extend the functionality of the root node, providing access to specific services or resources or offering specific types of dedicated processing, like calculator functionality, for example.\n#### template (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#template-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nn8n templates are pre-built workflows designed by n8n and community members that you can import into your n8n instance. When using templates, you may need to fill in credentials and adjust the configuration to suit your needs.\n#### trigger node (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#trigger-node-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nA trigger node is a special node responsible for executing the workflow in response to certain conditions. All production workflows need at least one trigger to determine when the workflow should run.\n#### workflow (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#workflow-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nAn n8n workflow is a collection of nodes that automate a process. Workflows begin execution when a trigger condition occurs and execute sequentially to achieve complex tasks.\nWas this page helpful? \nThanks for your feedback! \nThanks for your feedback!

      "markdown": "# Glossary\n#### AI agent[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-agent> \"Permanent link\")\nAI agents are artificial intelligence systems capable of responding to requests, making decisions, and performing real-world tasks for users. They use large language models (LLMs) to interpret user input and make decisions about how to best process requests using the information and resources they have available.\n#### AI chain[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-chain> \"Permanent link\")\nAI chains allow you to interact with large language models (LLMs) and other resources in sequences of calls to components. AI chains in n8n don't use persistent memory, so you can't use them to reference previous context (use AI agents for this).\n#### AI embedding[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-embedding> \"Permanent link\")\nEmbeddings are numerical representations of data using vectors. They're used by AI to interpret complex data and relationships by mapping values across many dimensions. Vector databases, or vector stores, are databases designed to store and access embeddings.\n#### AI groundedness[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-groundedness> \"Permanent link\")\nIn AI, and specifically in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) contexts, groundedness and ungroundedness are measures of how much a model's responses accurately reflect source information. The model uses its source documents to generate grounded responses, while ungrounded responses involve speculation or hallucination unsupported by those same sources.\n#### AI reranking[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-reranking> \"Permanent link\")\nReranking is a technique that refines the order of a list of candidate documents to improve the relevance of search results. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and other applications use reranking to prioritize the most relevant information for generation or downstream tasks.\n#### AI memory[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-memory> \"Permanent link\")\nIn an AI context, memory allows AI tools to persist message context across interactions. This allows you to have a continuing conversations with AI agents, for example, without submitting ongoing context with each message. In n8n, AI agent nodes can use memory, but AI chains can't.\n#### AI retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag> \"Permanent link\")\nRetrieval-augmented generation, or RAG, is a technique for providing LLMs access to new information from external sources to improve AI responses. RAG systems retrieve relevant documents to ground responses in up-to-date, domain-specific, or proprietary knowledge to supplement their original training data. RAG systems often rely on vector stores to manage and search this external data efficiently.\n#### AI tool[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-tool> \"Permanent link\")\nIn an AI context, a tool is an add-on resource that the AI can refer to for specific information or functionality when responding to a request. The AI model can use a tool to interact with external systems or complete specific, focused tasks.\n#### AI vector store[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-vector-store> \"Permanent link\")\nVector stores, or vector databases, are databases designed to store numerical representations of information called embeddings.\n#### API[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#api> \"Permanent link\")\nAPIs, or application programming interfaces, offer programmatic access to a service's data and functionality. APIs make it easier for software to interact with external systems. They're often offered as an alternative to traditional user-focused interfaces accessed through web browsers or UI.\n#### canvas (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#canvas-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nThe canvas is the main interface for building workflows in n8n's editor UI. You use the canvas to add and connect nodes to compose workflows.\n#### cluster node (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#cluster-node-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nIn n8n, cluster nodes are groups of nodes that work together to provide functionality in a workflow. They consist of a root node and one or more sub nodes that extend the node's functionality.\n#### credential (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#credential-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nIn n8n, credentials store authentication information to connect with specific apps and services. After creating credentials with your authentication information (username and password, API key, OAuth secrets, etc.), you can use the associated app node to interact with the service.\n#### data pinning (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#data-pinning-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nData pinning allows you to temporarily freeze the output data of a node during workflow development. This allows you to develop workflows with predictable data without making repeated requests to external services. Production workflows ignore pinned data and request new data on each execution.\n#### editor (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#editor-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nThe n8n editor UI allows you to create and manage workflows. The main area is the canvas, where you can compose workflows by adding, configuring, and connecting nodes. The side and top panels allow you to access other areas of the UI like credentials, templates, variables, executions, and more.\n#### entitlement (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#entitlement-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nIn n8n, entitlements grant n8n instances access to plan-restricted features for a specific period of time.\nFloating entitlements are a pool of entitlements that you can distribute among various n8n instances. You can re-assign a floating entitlement to transfer its access to a different n8n instance.\n#### evaluation (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#evaluation-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nIn n8n, evaluation allows you to tag and organize execution history and compare it against new executions. You can use this to understand how your workflow performs over time as you make changes. In particular, this is useful while developing AI-centered workflows.\n#### expression (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#expression-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nIn n8n, expressions allow you to populate node parameters dynamically by executing JavaScript code. Instead of providing a static value, you can use the n8n expression syntax to define the value using data from previous nodes, other workflows, or your n8n environment.\n#### LangChain[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#langchain> \"Permanent link\")\nLangChain is an AI-development framework used to work with large language models (LLMs). LangChain provides a standardized system for working with a wide variety of models and other resources and linking different components together to build complex applications.\n#### Large language model (LLM)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#large-language-model-llm> \"Permanent link\")\nLarge language models, or LLMs, are AI machine learning models designed to excel in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. They're built by training on large amounts of data to develop probabilistic models of language and other data.\n#### node (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#node-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nIn n8n, nodes are individual components that you compose to create workflows. Nodes define when the workflow should run, allow you to fetch, send, and process data, can define flow control logic, and connect with external services.\n#### project (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#project-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nn8n projects allow you to separate workflows, variables, and credentials into separate groups for easier management. Projects make it easier for teams to collaborate by sharing and compartmentalizing related resources.\n#### root node (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#root-node-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nEach n8n cluster node contains a single root nodes that defines the main functionality of the cluster. One or more sub nodes attach to the root node to extend its functionality.\n#### sub node (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#sub-node-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nn8n cluster nodes consist of one or more sub nodes connected to a root node. Sub nodes extend the functionality of the root node, providing access to specific services or resources or offering specific types of dedicated processing, like calculator functionality, for example.\n#### template (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#template-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nn8n templates are pre-built workflows designed by n8n and community members that you can import into your n8n instance. When using templates, you may need to fill in credentials and adjust the configuration to suit your needs.\n#### trigger node (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#trigger-node-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nA trigger node is a special node responsible for executing the workflow in response to certain conditions. All production workflows need at least one trigger to determine when the workflow should run.\n#### workflow (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#workflow-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nAn n8n workflow is a collection of nodes that automate a process. Workflows begin execution when a trigger condition occurs and execute sequentially to achieve complex tasks.\nWas this page helpful? \nThanks for your feedback! \nThanks for your feedback!

They use large language models (LLMs) to interpret user input and make decisions about how to best process requests using the information and resources they have available.\n#### AI chain[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-chain> \"Permanent link\")\nAI chains allow you to interact with large language models (LLMs) and other resources in sequences of calls to components. AI chains in n8n don't use persistent memory, so you can't use them to reference previous context (use AI agents for this).\n#### AI embedding[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-embedding> \"Permanent link\")\nEmbeddings are numerical representations of data using vectors. They're used by AI to interpret complex data and relationships by mapping values across many dimensions. Vector databases, or vector stores, are databases designed to store and access embeddings.\n#### AI groundedness[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-groundedness> \"Permanent link\")\nIn AI, and specifically in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) contexts, groundedness and ungroundedness are measures of how much a model's responses accurately reflect source information. The model uses its source documents to generate grounded responses, while ungrounded responses involve speculation or hallucination unsupported by those same sources.\n#### AI reranking[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-reranking> \"Permanent link\")\nReranking is a technique that refines the order of a list of candidate documents to improve the relevance of search results. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and other applications use reranking to prioritize the most relevant information for generation or downstream tasks.\n#### AI memory[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-memory> \"Permanent link\")\nIn an AI context, memory allows AI tools to persist message context across interactions. This allows you to have a continuing conversations with AI agents, for example, without submitting ongoing context with each message. In n8n, AI agent nodes can use memory, but AI chains can't.\n#### AI retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag> \"Permanent link\")\nRetrieval-augmented generation, or RAG, is a technique for providing LLMs access to new information from external sources to improve AI responses. RAG systems retrieve relevant documents to ground responses in up-to-date, domain-specific, or proprietary knowledge to supplement their original training data. RAG systems often rely on vector stores to manage and search this external data efficiently.\n#### AI tool[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-tool> \"Permanent link\")\nIn an AI context, a tool is an add-on resource that the AI can refer to for specific information or functionality when responding to a request. The AI model can use a tool to interact with external systems or complete specific, focused tasks.\n#### AI vector store[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#ai-vector-store> \"Permanent link\")\nVector stores, or vector databases, are databases designed to store numerical representations of information called embeddings.\n#### API[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#api> \"Permanent link\")\nAPIs, or application programming interfaces, offer programmatic access to a service's data and functionality. APIs make it easier for software to interact with external systems. They're often offered as an alternative to traditional user-focused interfaces accessed through web browsers or UI.\n#### canvas (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#canvas-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nThe canvas is the main interface for building workflows in n8n's editor UI. You use the canvas to add and connect nodes to compose workflows.\n#### cluster node (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#cluster-node-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nIn n8n, cluster nodes are groups of nodes that work together to provide functionality in a workflow. They consist of a root node and one or more sub nodes that extend the node's functionality.\n#### credential (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#credential-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nIn n8n, credentials store authentication information to connect with specific apps and services. After creating credentials with your authentication information (username and password, API key, OAuth secrets, etc.), you can use the associated app node to interact with the service.\n#### data pinning (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#data-pinning-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nData pinning allows you to temporarily freeze the output data of a node during workflow development. This allows you to develop workflows with predictable data without making repeated requests to external services. Production workflows ignore pinned data and request new data on each execution.\n#### editor (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#editor-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nThe n8n editor UI allows you to create and manage workflows. The main area is the canvas, where you can compose workflows by adding, configuring, and connecting nodes. The side and top panels allow you to access other areas of the UI like credentials, templates, variables, executions, and more.\n#### entitlement (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#entitlement-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nIn n8n, entitlements grant n8n instances access to plan-restricted features for a specific period of time.\nFloating entitlements are a pool of entitlements that you can distribute among various n8n instances. You can re-assign a floating entitlement to transfer its access to a different n8n instance.\n#### evaluation (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#evaluation-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nIn n8n, evaluation allows you to tag and organize execution history and compare it against new executions. You can use this to understand how your workflow performs over time as you make changes. In particular, this is useful while developing AI-centered workflows.\n#### expression (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#expression-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nIn n8n, expressions allow you to populate node parameters dynamically by executing JavaScript code. Instead of providing a static value, you can use the n8n expression syntax to define the value using data from previous nodes, other workflows, or your n8n environment.\n#### LangChain[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#langchain> \"Permanent link\")\nLangChain is an AI-development framework used to work with large language models (LLMs). LangChain provides a standardized system for working with a wide variety of models and other resources and linking different components together to build complex applications.\n#### Large language model (LLM)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#large-language-model-llm> \"Permanent link\")\nLarge language models, or LLMs, are AI machine learning models designed to excel in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. They're built by training on large amounts of data to develop probabilistic models of language and other data.\n#### node (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#node-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nIn n8n, nodes are individual components that you compose to create workflows. Nodes define when the workflow should run, allow you to fetch, send, and process data, can define flow control logic, and connect with external services.\n#### project (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#project-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nn8n projects allow you to separate workflows, variables, and credentials into separate groups for easier management. Projects make it easier for teams to collaborate by sharing and compartmentalizing related resources.\n#### root node (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#root-node-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nEach n8n cluster node contains a single root nodes that defines the main functionality of the cluster. One or more sub nodes attach to the root node to extend its functionality.\n#### sub node (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#sub-node-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nn8n cluster nodes consist of one or more sub nodes connected to a root node. Sub nodes extend the functionality of the root node, providing access to specific services or resources or offering specific types of dedicated processing, like calculator functionality, for example.\n#### template (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#template-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nn8n templates are pre-built workflows designed by n8n and community members that you can import into your n8n instance. When using templates, you may need to fill in credentials and adjust the configuration to suit your needs.\n#### trigger node (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#trigger-node-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nA trigger node is a special node responsible for executing the workflow in response to certain conditions. All production workflows need at least one trigger to determine when the workflow should run.\n#### workflow (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#workflow-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nAn n8n workflow is a collection of nodes that automate a process. Workflows begin execution when a trigger condition occurs and execute sequentially to achieve complex tasks.\nWas this page helpful? \nThanks for your feedback! \nThanks for your feedback!

Sub nodes extend the functionality of the root node, providing access to specific services or resources or offering specific types of dedicated processing, like calculator functionality, for example.\n#### template (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#template-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nn8n templates are pre-built workflows designed by n8n and community members that you can import into your n8n instance. When using templates, you may need to fill in credentials and adjust the configuration to suit your needs.\n#### trigger node (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#trigger-node-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nA trigger node is a special node responsible for executing the workflow in response to certain conditions. All production workflows need at least one trigger to determine when the workflow should run.\n#### workflow (n8n)[#](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/<#workflow-n8n> \"Permanent link\")\nAn n8n workflow is a collection of nodes that automate a process. Workflows begin execution when a trigger condition occurs and execute sequentially to achieve complex tasks.\nWas this page helpful? \nThanks for your feedback! \nThanks for your feedback!

They perform a range of actions, including:\n  * Starting the workflow.\n  * Fetching and sending data.\n  * Processing and manipulating data.\n\nn8n provides a collection of built-in nodes, as well as the ability to create your own nodes. Refer to:\n  * [Built-in integrations](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/components/integrations/builtin/node-types/>) to browse the node library.\n  * [Community nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/components/integrations/community-nodes/installation/>) for guidance on finding and installing community-created nodes.\n  * [Creating nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/components/integrations/creating-nodes/overview/>) to start building your own nodes.\n\n## Add a node to your workflow[#](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/components/nodes/<#add-a-node-to-your-workflow> \"Permanent link\")\n### Add a node to an empty workflow[#](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/components/nodes/<#add-a-node-to-an-empty-workflow> \"Permanent link\")\n  1. Select **Add first step**. n8n opens the nodes panel, where you can search or browse [trigger nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/components/glossary/#trigger-node-n8n>).\n  2. Select the trigger you want to use.\nChoose the correct app event\nIf you select **On App Event** , n8n shows a list of all the supported services. Use this list to browse n8n's integrations and trigger a workflow in response to an event in your chosen service. Not all integrations have triggers. To see which ones you can use as a trigger, select the node. If a trigger is available, you'll see it at the top of the available operations list.\nFor example, this is the trigger for Asana:\n[](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/components/nodes/<https:/docs.n8n.io/_images/workflows/components/nodes/recommended-trigger.png>)\n\n### Add a node to an existing workflow[#](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/components/nodes/<#add-a-node-to-an-existing-workflow> \"Permanent link\")\nSelect the **Add node** connector. n8n opens the nodes panel, where you can search or browse all nodes.\n## Node operations: Triggers and Actions[#](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/components/nodes/<#node-operations-triggers-and-actions> \"Permanent link\")\nWhen you add a node to a workflow, n8n displays a list of available operations. An operation is something a node does, such as getting or sending data.\nThere are two types of operation:\n  * Triggers start a workflow in response to specific events or conditions in your services. When you select a Trigger, n8n adds a trigger node to your workflow, with the Trigger operation you chose pre-selected. When you search for a node in n8n, Trigger operations have a bolt icon .\n  * Actions are operations that represent specific tasks within a workflow, which you can use to manipulate data, perform operations on external systems, and trigger events in other systems as part of your workflows. When you select an Action, n8n adds a node to your workflow, with the Action operation you chose pre-selected.\n\n## Node controls[#](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/components/nodes/<#node-controls> \"Permanent link\")\nTo view node controls, hover over the node on the canvas:\n  * **Execute step** : Run the node.\n  * **Deactivate** : Deactivate the node.\n  * **Delete** : Delete the node.\n  * **Node context menu** : Select node actions.

Be careful setting this on IF nodes, as it could cause an infinite loop.\n  * **Execute Once** : The node executes once, with data from the first item it receives. It doesn't process any extra items.\n  * **Retry On Fail** : When an execution fails, the node reruns until it succeeds. \n  * **On Error** : \n    * **Stop Workflow** : Halts the entire workflow when an error occurs, preventing further node execution.\n    * **Continue** : Proceeds to the next node despite the error, using the last valid data.\n    * **Continue (using error output)** : Continues workflow execution, passing error information to the next node for potential handling.\n\nYou can document your workflow using node notes:\n  * **Notes** : Note to save with the node.\n  * **Display note in flow** : If active, n8n displays the note in the workflow as a subtitle.\n\nWas this page helpful? \nThanks for your feedback! \nThanks for your feedback!
