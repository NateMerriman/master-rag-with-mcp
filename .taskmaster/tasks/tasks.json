Set a reasonable TTL (e.g., 1 hour) for cache entries. Invalidation logic should be triggered when underlying source documents are updated. Use environment variables for Redis connection details (`REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, `REDIS_DB`).\n\nPseudo-code:\n```python\nimport redis\nimport hashlib\n\nredis_client = redis.Redis(host=REDIS_HOST, port=REDIS_PORT, db=REDIS_DB)\n\ndef cache_results(ttl_seconds=3600):\n    def decorator(func):\n        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n            query_params = str(args) + str(kwargs)\n            cache_key = f'query:{hashlib.md5(query_params.encode()).hexdigest()}'\n            cached_result = redis_client.get(cache_key)\n            if cached_result:\n                return json.loads(cached_result)\n            result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n            redis_client.setex(cache_key, ttl_seconds, json.dumps(result))\n            return result\n        return wrapper\n    return decorator\n```",
