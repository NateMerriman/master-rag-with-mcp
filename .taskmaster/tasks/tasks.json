Use environment variables for Redis connection details (`REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, `REDIS_DB`).\n\nPseudo-code:\n```python\nimport redis\nimport hashlib\n\nredis_client = redis.Redis(host=REDIS_HOST, port=REDIS_PORT, db=REDIS_DB)\n\ndef cache_results(ttl_seconds=3600):\n    def decorator(func):\n        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n            query_params = str(args) + str(kwargs)\n            cache_key = f'query:{hashlib.md5(query_params.encode()).hexdigest()}'\n            cached_result = redis_client.get(cache_key)\n            if cached_result:\n                return json.loads(cached_result)\n            result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n            redis_client.setex(cache_key, ttl_seconds, json.dumps(result))\n            return result\n        return wrapper\n    return decorator\n```",

The primary goal is to create a robust AdvancedWebCrawler that reliably extracts clean, high-quality markdown from modern, JavaScript-heavy websites.

        "details": "The current crawler struggles with client-side rendered websites. The solution is to implement an AdvancedWebCrawler using `crawl4ai` that can produce clean markdown suitable for a downstream `DocumentIngestionPipeline`.\n\nThis involves several key strategies:\n\n1.  **Browser Automation:** Utilize `crawl4ai` with `browser=\"playwright\"` to fully render pages, executing all JavaScript to get the final DOM that a user sees. This is essential for SPAs like promptingguide.ai.\n\n2.  **Intelligent Extraction & Filtering:** Combine `TrafilaturaExtractor` for its advanced heuristics with precision targeting. The extractor should be scoped to the main content area (`css_selector=\"main article\"`) and exclude specific boilerplate elements (`extraction_exclude_selectors`) like sidebars, headers, and footers.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Content Handling:** Implement robust wait strategies using `playwright_options` (e.g., `{\"wait_for\": {\"selector\": \"main article\", \"timeout\": 20000}}`) to ensure dynamic content is fully loaded before extraction begins.\n\n4.  **Optimized Markdown Output:** Configure the `Html2TextConverter` to generate clean, structured markdown optimized for a `SemanticChunker`. Settings like `ignore_images=True`, `protect_links=True`, and `bodywidth=0` are critical for producing output that is easy to chunk and process while preserving semantic meaning.\n\n**Target Implementation Pattern:**\nThe crawler's output should be directly consumable by a `DocumentIngestionPipeline`. The configuration should resemble the following:\n\n```python\nfrom crawl4ai import Crawler\nfrom crawl4ai.extractors import TrafilaturaExtractor\nfrom crawl4ai.converters import Html2TextConverter\n\nadvanced_web_crawler = Crawler(\n    browser=\"playwright\",\n    extractor=TrafilaturaExtractor(),\n    converter=Html2TextConverter(\n        ignore_links=False, \n        ignore_images=True, \n        protect_links=True, \n        bodywidth=0, \n        escape_all=True\n    ),\n    css_selector=\"main article\",\n    extraction_exclude_selectors=[\n        \"nav.navbar\", \n        \"footer.footer\", \n        \"aside.theme-doc-sidebar-container\",\n        \".theme-doc-toc\",\n        \".theme-edit-this-page\",\n        \".pagination-nav\"\n    ],\n    playwright_options={\"wait_for\": {\"selector\": \"main article\", \"timeout\": 20000}}\n)\n```\nThis approach ensures the crawler's role is cleanly defined: to turn a URL into a high-quality markdown document, ready for the next stage of the RAG pipeline.",

Create an integration test targeting problematic URLs (e.g., 'https://promptingguide.ai/').

Develop a content quality validation suite. This should programmatically check the markdown for common issues like leftover HTML tags, excessive newlines, or script content.\n3. Create a test harness that feeds the crawler's output into a prototype `DocumentIngestionPipeline` (or at least a `SemanticChunker`). The test passes if the markdown is chunked correctly without errors, demonstrating its suitability for the target architecture.\n4. Run regression tests against known-good websites to ensure the changes don't negatively impact existing functionality.",

Files created include the DocumentStorage class in document_ingestion_pipeline.py, test_storage_basic.py for basic functionality tests, and test_storage_integration.py for integration testing. This completes the storage layer of the DocumentIngestionPipeline, providing a reliable and feature-rich persistence solution ready for integration with the AdvancedWebCrawler output.\n</info added on 2025-07-01T19:35:18.603Z>",

This task requires comprehensive fixes to the quality calculation system:\n\n**1. Enhanced Navigation Pattern Detection:**\n- Add specific patterns for bulleted integration lists (e.g., lists containing multiple links with integration-related terms)\n- Implement link-heavy content detection (calculate link-to-text ratio and flag content with >40% link density)\n- Add patterns for n8n-specific integration content (detect lists with terms like 'node', 'integration', 'connector')\n- Lower word count thresholds for navigation detection (content with <50 words and high link density should be flagged)\n\n**2. Quality Score Calculation Improvements:**\n- Implement penalties for excessive bullet-point lists with links (reduce score by 0.3-0.5 for each navigation list detected)\n- Add weighted scoring that considers content structure, not just keyword presence\n- Ensure navigation-heavy content receives scores <0.3 regardless of keyword matches\n- Implement cascading penalties where multiple navigation indicators compound the score reduction\n\n**3. Validation Logic Enhancements:**\n- Add content-to-navigation ratio calculations\n- Implement semantic analysis to distinguish between informational lists and navigation lists\n- Add specific validation for common navigation patterns found in documentation sites\n- Create content type classification (navigation, content, mixed) with appropriate scoring\n<info added on 2025-07-03T17:48:35.679Z>\n## Research-Based Analysis and Implementation Strategy\n\nBased on comprehensive research into navigation detection and quality validation systems, the following advanced solutions have been identified for implementation:\n\n**Advanced Navigation Pattern Detection Techniques:**\n- Implement structural analysis of list-item link dominance where navigation elements exhibit distinct patterns (lists where nearly every item contains a link)\n- Deploy text-to-link ratio analysis to identify content with minimal non-link text (e.g., \"* [My Integration](...)\" has zero text-to-link ratio)\n- Add semantic context analysis by checking headers preceding list blocks (patterns like \"Integrations,\" \"Categories,\" \"Related Articles\" indicate navigation sections)\n- Implement shallow structure detection as navigation menus are typically flat lists lacking structural diversity of main content\n\n**Machine Learning Classification Approach:**\n- Develop a Logistic Regression or Gradient Boosting classifier using features: link density, text-to-link ratio, word count, structural features (list/paragraph/heading counts), HTML tag ratios, CSS class patterns, and text coherence metrics\n- Create training pipeline with labeled data from problematic sites like n8n.io to build robust content vs navigation classification\n- Integrate ML model to operate on HTML before markdown conversion, allowing early rejection of navigation blocks\n\n**Enhanced CSS Selector Specificity:**\n- Utilize advanced pseudo-classes like :not() for exclusion (e.g., \"main div:not(.sidebar)\") and :has() for parent-child relationships\n- Implement attribute selectors targeting semantic elements like [role=\"navigation\"] and [aria-label*=\"menu\"]\n- Extend DocumentationSiteConfig to support both inclusion and exclusion selectors for fine-grained control\n- Add site-specific exclusion patterns (e.g., for n8n.io: \".md-content__source\", \".md-typeset__scrollwrap\", \"nav\", \"[aria-label='Table of contents']\")\n\n**Quality Scoring Algorithm Enhancements:**\n- Implement non-linear penalties with link density cliffs (scores drop drastically when link density exceeds 0.4)\n- Add structural diversity scoring rewarding content with mix of paragraphs, headings, and code blocks\n- Introduce word count floors with heavy penalties for content below 50 words without code blocks\n- Deploy penalty multipliers that can reduce scores by 90-95% when multiple navigation indicators are present\n\n**Real-time Validation Feedback Systems:**\n- Establish CI/CD quality gates with automated pytest tests using curated good/bad URL sets\n- Implement human-in-the-loop feedback for edge cases with logging of quality failures\n- Create review interfaces allowing developers to update CSS selectors, add to golden sets, or dismiss irrelevant failures\n- Deploy continuous improvement loop turning failures into training data for system hardening\n\n**Implementation Priority:**\n1. Enhanced navigation pattern detection in content_quality_analyzer.py\n2. CSS selector improvements in DocumentationSiteConfig\n3. Non-linear penalty system in quality scoring\n4. Automated test suite for regression prevention\n5. Machine learning classification (longer-term enhancement)\n\nThis research-backed approach ensures comprehensive navigation detection improvements while maintaining backward compatibility and providing measurable quality validation.\n</info added on 2025-07-03T17:48:35.679Z>",

Content Quality Validation:**\n- Implement content validation to detect when navigation content is extracted instead of main content\n- Add quality metrics to measure content-to-navigation ratio\n- Create alerts when extraction quality drops below acceptable thresholds\n<info added on 2025-07-03T17:50:25.800Z>\n**Research-Backed Implementation Plan:**\n\nBased on comprehensive research into CSS selector system failures for n8n.io content extraction, the following actionable solutions have been identified to fix the navigation targeting issue:\n\n**Advanced CSS Selector Debugging Implementation:**\n- Use browser DevTools methodology: Navigate to docs.n8n.io/glossary/, inspect elements, and test selectors in console using $$('selector') function\n- Current selectors 'main.md-main' and 'article.md-content__inner' are too broad and capture entire main container including sidebars\n- Precise diagnosis reveals Material for MkDocs framework structure where navigation sidebars are siblings to content area\n- Recommended replacement selector: 'main.md-main .md-content' which targets only the content container excluding sidebars\n\n**Material Design Framework-Specific Updates:**\nUpdate documentation_site_config.py n8n configuration:\n```python\ncontent_selectors=[\"main.md-main .md-content\"]\n```\nUpdate enhanced_crawler_config.py MATERIAL_DESIGN framework config:\n```python\ntarget_elements=[\"main.md-main .md-content\", \"article.md-content__inner\"]\nexcluded_selectors=[\".md-sidebar\", \".md-nav\", \"nav.md-tabs\", \".md-header\", \".md-footer\", \"nav.md-path\"]\n```\n\n**Robust Fallback Selector Hierarchy:**\nImplement 4-tier fallback system in advanced_web_crawler.py:\n- Tier 1: High-precision framework selectors (Material for MkDocs, ReadMe.io, GitBook, Docusaurus)\n- Tier 2: Standard semantic HTML5 containers (main article, article, main, [role='main'])\n- Tier 3: Common generic class names (.content, .main-content, .page-content)\n- Tier 4: Last resort broad exclusions\n\n**Real-Time Selector Effectiveness Validation:**\nImplement content quality heuristics in should_retry_extraction function:\n- Link density check: flag if (markdown links / word count) > 0.4\n- Average text length per list item: flag if < 5 words\n- Text-to-tag ratio validation\n- Navigation keyword detection for terms like \"Next\", \"Previous\", \"Home\", \"API\"\n- Quality score threshold of 0.4 to trigger selector retry\n\n**Performance Optimization Guidelines:**\n- Use specific selectors (div.md-content faster than .md-content)\n- Avoid universal selector and complex :not() pseudo-classes except as last resort\n- Prefer class/ID selectors over attribute selectors\n- Consider right-to-left selector evaluation for performance\n\n**Implementation Priority:**\n1. Update n8n.io specific selectors in documentation_site_config.py (immediate fix)\n2. Enhance Material Design framework configuration\n3. Implement robust fallback hierarchy\n4. Add real-time validation with quality metrics feedback loop\n\nThis research-backed approach provides both immediate fixes for n8n.io and systematic improvements to prevent similar issues across all Material for MkDocs sites.\n</info added on 2025-07-03T17:50:25.800Z>",

Import Dependencies Resolution:**\n- Identify and fix all 'No module named config' errors occurring during crawling operations\n- Audit import statements in contextual embedding system modules\n- Ensure proper module path resolution and package structure\n- Add missing __init__.py files if needed\n- Verify all configuration modules are properly accessible\n\n**2. Quality Override Logic Repair (lines 482-484 in advanced_web_crawler.py):**\n- Fix the flawed enhanced quality system that overrides legacy validation inappropriately\n- Add comprehensive validation checks for enhanced quality metrics before applying them\n- Implement sanity checks to prevent perfect scores (1.000) for obvious navigation content\n- Add safeguards that detect when enhanced quality metrics are unreliable or suspicious\n- Restore legacy validation as a fallback mechanism when enhanced quality fails\n- Ensure navigation content (bulleted lists, menus, links) receives appropriately low quality scores\n\n**3. Enhanced Quality Validation:**\n- Add logging to track when quality override logic is triggered\n- Implement threshold checks for enhanced quality metrics\n- Create validation rules that flag suspicious perfect scores\n- Add fallback mechanisms that revert to legacy validation when enhanced system produces implausible results\n- Ensure quality scores reflect actual content value, not navigation elements\n<info added on 2025-07-03T17:52:10.839Z>\n**Research Results: Comprehensive Solutions for Quality Override and Import Dependencies**\n\nBased on extensive research into Python import resolution, quality validation systems, and error handling patterns, here are the key findings and actionable solutions:\n\n**Import Resolution Root Cause Analysis:**\nThe recurring 'No module named config' errors stem from Python's sys.path not including the project's source directories during runtime. The current try/except ImportError blocks are temporary patches masking structural issues. The recommended solution is implementing an installable package structure with pyproject.toml, enabling reliable absolute imports and eliminating path manipulation hacks.\n\n**Quality Override Logic Critical Flaw:**\nThe dangerous \"fail-open\" state occurs because quality_score defaults to 1.0 (perfect). When validation systems fail to execute, content receives perfect scores by default. The fix requires changing the default to 0.0 (fail-closed) and implementing explicit priority-based validation flow: Enhanced System → Legacy Fallback → Explicit Handling.\n\n**Intelligent Fallback Optimization:**\nCurrent fallback mechanisms can be enhanced by analyzing ContentQualityMetrics to determine failure modes. High link_density suggests navigation contamination requiring aggressive exclusion selectors. Low word_count indicates selector failure needing broader CSS targets. Dynamic configuration adjustment based on previous attempt metrics will improve success rates.\n\n**Structured Logging Implementation:**\nJSON-formatted structured logging with contextual fields (url, attempt, configuration) enables powerful filtering and analysis in monitoring tools like Grafana Loki. This supports the monitoring goals and facilitates debugging specific crawler failures across distributed environments.\n\n**Exception Handling Granularity:**\nReplace broad Exception handlers with specific exception types (PlaywrightTimeoutError, aiohttp.ClientError) to enable targeted error responses. Network errors may be fatal for a URL, while timeouts might warrant retry with extended wait times.\n\n**Integration Pattern Recommendations:**\nThe current Enhanced → Legacy priority approach is sound. Shadow mode operation (running both systems for comparison) provides validation data for eventual legacy system deprecation. Ensemble methods combining scores could prevent edge cases but add complexity.\n\n**Actionable Implementation Priority:**\n1. Fix import structure with installable package setup\n2. Correct quality_score default initialization to fail-closed\n3. Implement priority-based validation flow with explicit logging\n4. Add intelligent fallback configuration based on failure analysis\n5. Deploy structured logging for production monitoring readiness\n\nThese solutions address the core reliability issues while preparing the crawler for REST API integration and multi-modal content handling in upcoming tasks.\n</info added on 2025-07-03T17:52:10.839Z>",

Assert that after the fixes, these samples receive quality scores <0.3 and that the override logic properly validates enhanced metrics.\n\n3. **Fallback Validation Test**: Create test scenarios where enhanced quality metrics are intentionally corrupted or return suspicious values. Verify that the system correctly falls back to legacy validation and produces reasonable quality scores.\n\n4. **End-to-End Crawling Test**: Run a complete crawling session on n8n.io documentation and verify that no import errors occur and that navigation content receives appropriately low quality scores while actual content receives higher scores.",
