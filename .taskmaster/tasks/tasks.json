Set a reasonable TTL (e.g., 1 hour) for cache entries. Invalidation logic should be triggered when underlying source documents are updated. Use environment variables for Redis connection details (`REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, `REDIS_DB`).\n\nPseudo-code:\n```python\nimport redis\nimport hashlib\n\nredis_client = redis.Redis(host=REDIS_HOST, port=REDIS_PORT, db=REDIS_DB)\n\ndef cache_results(ttl_seconds=3600):\n    def decorator(func):\n        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n            query_params = str(args) + str(kwargs)\n            cache_key = f'query:{hashlib.md5(query_params.encode()).hexdigest()}'\n            cached_result = redis_client.get(cache_key)\n            if cached_result:\n                return json.loads(cached_result)\n            result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n            redis_client.setex(cache_key, ttl_seconds, json.dumps(result))\n            return result\n        return wrapper\n    return decorator\n```",

The primary goal is to create a robust AdvancedWebCrawler that reliably extracts clean, high-quality markdown from modern, JavaScript-heavy websites.

        "details": "The current crawler struggles with client-side rendered websites. The solution is to implement an AdvancedWebCrawler using `crawl4ai` that can produce clean markdown suitable for a downstream `DocumentIngestionPipeline`.\n\nThis involves several key strategies:\n\n1.  **Browser Automation:** Utilize `crawl4ai` with `browser=\"playwright\"` to fully render pages, executing all JavaScript to get the final DOM that a user sees. This is essential for SPAs like promptingguide.ai.\n\n2.  **Intelligent Extraction & Filtering:** Combine `TrafilaturaExtractor` for its advanced heuristics with precision targeting. The extractor should be scoped to the main content area (`css_selector=\"main article\"`) and exclude specific boilerplate elements (`extraction_exclude_selectors`) like sidebars, headers, and footers.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Content Handling:** Implement robust wait strategies using `playwright_options` (e.g., `{\"wait_for\": {\"selector\": \"main article\", \"timeout\": 20000}}`) to ensure dynamic content is fully loaded before extraction begins.\n\n4.  **Optimized Markdown Output:** Configure the `Html2TextConverter` to generate clean, structured markdown optimized for a `SemanticChunker`. Settings like `ignore_images=True`, `protect_links=True`, and `bodywidth=0` are critical for producing output that is easy to chunk and process while preserving semantic meaning.\n\n**Target Implementation Pattern:**\nThe crawler's output should be directly consumable by a `DocumentIngestionPipeline`. The configuration should resemble the following:\n\n```python\nfrom crawl4ai import Crawler\nfrom crawl4ai.extractors import TrafilaturaExtractor\nfrom crawl4ai.converters import Html2TextConverter\n\nadvanced_web_crawler = Crawler(\n    browser=\"playwright\",\n    extractor=TrafilaturaExtractor(),\n    converter=Html2TextConverter(\n        ignore_links=False, \n        ignore_images=True, \n        protect_links=True, \n        bodywidth=0, \n        escape_all=True\n    ),\n    css_selector=\"main article\",\n    extraction_exclude_selectors=[\n        \"nav.navbar\", \n        \"footer.footer\", \n        \"aside.theme-doc-sidebar-container\",\n        \".theme-doc-toc\",\n        \".theme-edit-this-page\",\n        \".pagination-nav\"\n    ],\n    playwright_options={\"wait_for\": {\"selector\": \"main article\", \"timeout\": 20000}}\n)\n```\nThis approach ensures the crawler's role is cleanly defined: to turn a URL into a high-quality markdown document, ready for the next stage of the RAG pipeline.",
        "testStrategy": "The test strategy must validate both the quality of the extracted markdown and its compatibility with the downstream ingestion pipeline.\n1. Create an integration test targeting problematic URLs (e.g., 'https://promptingguide.ai/').

Develop a content quality validation suite. This should programmatically check the markdown for common issues like leftover HTML tags, excessive newlines, or script content.\n3. Create a test harness that feeds the crawler's output into a prototype `DocumentIngestionPipeline` (or at least a `SemanticChunker`). The test passes if the markdown is chunked correctly without errors, demonstrating its suitability for the target architecture.\n4. Run regression tests against known-good websites to ensure the changes don't negatively impact existing functionality.",

Key achievements include creating a complete storage component that uses existing utils.py functions, adding pipeline-specific metadata for tracking and audit trails, implementing robust error handling with graceful degradation, and creating comprehensive test suites covering both basic functionality and integration scenarios. The implementation maintains full compatibility with the existing crawled_pages table while adding enhanced capabilities for document ID generation, chunk data preparation, and batch processing with configurable sizes. Files created include the DocumentStorage class in document_ingestion_pipeline.py, test_storage_basic.py for basic functionality tests, and test_storage_integration.py for integration testing. This completes the storage layer of the DocumentIngestionPipeline, providing a reliable and feature-rich persistence solution ready for integration with the AdvancedWebCrawler output.\n</info added on 2025-07-01T19:35:18.603Z>",
