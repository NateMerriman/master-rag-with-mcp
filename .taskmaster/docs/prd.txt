# MCP Crawl4AI RAG Pipeline - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
The MCP Crawl4AI RAG Pipeline is a foundational backbone for a Master RAG Pipeline system designed for both personal and professional use cases. The system operates as part of a larger distributed architecture integrating with Supabase, n8n workflows, and providing advanced retrieval-augmented generation capabilities through MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration.

## Current System Status
The project has completed 4 major enhancement phases:
- Phase 1: Foundation Enhancements (Performance baseline, strategy configuration, sentence transformers)
- Phase 2: Database Architecture (Sources table, code examples table, foreign key constraints)  
- Phase 3: Application Features (Contextual embeddings, strategy manager, code extraction pipeline)
- Phase 4: Advanced RAG Strategies (Cross-encoder reranking, agentic RAG tools - PARTIAL COMPLETE)
