# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Persona
You are an expert developer proficient in both front- and back-end development with a deep understanding of python for AI development, Node.js, Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS.

## Overall guidelines
- Assume that the user is a junior developer.
- Always think through problems step-by-step.
- Do not go beyond the scope of the user's query/message.

## Project Context

This project serves as the foundational backbone for a Master RAG Pipeline - a highly advanced retrieval-augmented generation system designed for both personal and professional use cases. The system operates as part of a larger distributed architecture:

- **Supabase Integration**: Connected to a self-hosted Supabase Docker stack with specialized edge functions
- **n8n Workflows**: Integrated with multiple agentic n8n workflows running in separate containers
- **System Dependencies**: Changes to this codebase may impact connected systems and workflows

**Important**: When making modifications, consider the downstream effects on the broader RAG ecosystem, including n8n workflow integrations and Supabase database operations.

## Supabase Integration Architecture

This project connects to a **self-hosted Supabase Docker setup** (documented in `supabase_overview.md`) with the following critical components:

### Core Supabase Infrastructure
- **Dockerized Supabase Stack**: Complete services including Auth, Database, Storage, Realtime, and Studio
- **Edge Functions**: Three Deno-based functions providing semantic search via OpenAI embeddings
- **Postgres RPC Functions**: Backend hybrid search functions (`hybrid_search_crawled_pages`)
- **Service Ports**: Studio (54323), API (54321), Database (54322), Inbucket (54324)

### Critical Database Dependencies
- **Primary Table**: `crawled_pages` - stores web content chunks with 1536-dimension OpenAI embeddings
- **Hybrid Search RPC**: `hybrid_search_crawled_pages` - combines semantic + full-text search with RRF
- **Vector Support**: HNSW indexing for semantic search, PostgreSQL FTS with English language support
- **Schema Requirements**: JSONB metadata with GIN indexing, vector embeddings (text-embedding-3-small)

### External System Impact
**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Any changes to database schema, indexes, or RPC functions may break:
- Connected n8n agentic workflows running in Docker
- External edge functions calling hybrid search endpoints
- The broader Master RAG Pipeline system architecture

**Required for all database changes**:
- Test against the full Supabase Docker stack
- Validate edge function compatibility
- Verify n8n workflow integration points
- Confirm RPC function signatures remain consistent

## Project Evolution & Reference

This project is derived from an older version of a reference repository, but has since been significantly enhanced and modified. The `reference-repo.md` file contains documentation from the most recent version of the original repository and serves purely as a reference for potential enhancements.

**Key Points about reference-repo.md**:
- Contains updated functionality and enhancements from the original project's latest release
- Should be used only as a reference guide for identifying beneficial features to incorporate
- This project has already been substantially enhanced beyond the original fork
- When implementing ideas from reference-repo.md, avoid redundancies and unnecessary changes
- Focus on seamlessly integrating only the core improvements that complement existing enhancements

**Development Approach**: When considering updates from the reference repository, carefully evaluate whether new features add value without disrupting the current project's advanced functionality and integrations.

- When writing complex logic, **add an inline `# Reason:` comment** explaining the why, not just the what.

### 🗄️ Database Operations & Setup Scripts
- **Prefer manual SQL scripts over Python for database operations** when more reliable and efficient
- **Create standalone .sql files** for complex migrations, schema changes, and data operations
- **Include validation steps** in SQL scripts with clear status messages and progress indicators
- **Always create both migration and rollback scripts** for any database changes
- **Test scripts in Supabase Studio** before committing to ensure compatibility
- **Use descriptive script names** like `populate_source_ids_manual.sql`, `add_foreign_key_constraint.sql`
- **Include step-by-step instructions** in script headers for easy execution
- **Provide both automated Python tools AND manual SQL scripts** for flexibility in different scenarios

### ✅ Task Completion
- **Mark completed tasks in `TASK.md`** immediately after finishing them.
- Add new sub-tasks or TODOs discovered during development to `TASK.md` under a "Discovered During Work" section.

### 🧪 Testing & Reliability
- **Always create Pytest unit tests for new features** (functions, classes, routes, etc).
- **After updating any logic**, check whether existing unit tests need to be updated. If so, do it.
- **Tests should live in a `/tests` folder** mirroring the main app structure.
  - Include at least:
    - 1 test for expected use
    - 1 edge case
    - 1 failure case

### 🧱 Code Structure & Modularity
- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.
- **Use clear, consistent imports** (prefer relative imports within packages).

## Architecture

### Core Components

**MCP Server (`src/crawl4ai_mcp.py`)**
- Main FastMCP server providing 4 core tools for web crawling and RAG
- Uses AsyncWebCrawler with automatic browser lifecycle management
- Integrates with Supabase for vector storage and hybrid search

**Manual Crawler (`src/manual_crawl.py`)**
- Standalone script for large crawling jobs that would timeout through MCP
- Uses same crawling logic but with progress bars and batch processing
- Handles sitemap parsing, recursive crawling, and text file processing

**Utilities (`src/utils.py`)**
- Supabase client management and document storage
- OpenAI embedding generation with rate limit handling
- Contextual embedding generation when MODEL_CHOICE env var is set
- Hybrid search implementation combining full-text and semantic search

### Key Features

**Smart URL Detection**: Automatically detects and handles sitemaps (.xml), text files (.txt), and regular webpages with different crawling strategies.

**Hybrid Search**: Uses Supabase RPC function `hybrid_search_crawled_pages` that combines full-text search (PostgreSQL FTS) with semantic vector search using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF).

**Contextual Embeddings**: Optional feature that generates contextual summaries for chunks to improve retrieval accuracy when `MODEL_CHOICE` environment variable is set.

**Centralized Model Configuration**: The `CONTEXTUAL_MODEL` environment variable now controls all contextualization models across the entire codebase, including code extraction summaries and contextual embeddings. This provides a single source of truth for model selection.

**Chunking Strategy**: Smart markdown chunking that respects code blocks, paragraphs, and sentence boundaries while maintaining configurable chunk sizes.

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
SUPABASE_URL=your_url  
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_key

# Server config
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=8051
TRANSPORT=sse  # or stdio

# Optional - enables contextual embeddings (existing feature)
MODEL_CHOICE=gpt-4o-mini

# Enhancement project environment variables (all default false)
USE_CONTEXTUAL_EMBEDDINGS=false
USE_HYBRID_SEARCH_ENHANCED=false  
USE_AGENTIC_RAG=false
USE_RERANKING=false

# Model configuration for enhancements
CONTEXTUAL_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18  # Default fallback, can be overridden
RERANKING_MODEL=cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2

# IMPORTANT: For local testing, performance scripts temporarily override
# SUPABASE_URL from host.docker.internal:54321 to localhost:54321
# This preserves Docker networking for n8n while enabling local development
```

### Database Schema
**Current Schema:** The `crawled_pages` table stores chunked content with embeddings, full-text search vectors, and metadata. The hybrid search function provides both semantic and keyword-based retrieval with configurable weights.

**Enhancement Schema:** The enhancement project will add:
- `sources` table for centralized source management with metadata
- `code_examples` table for specialized code storage and search
- Foreign key relationships between tables for data integrity
- Additional indexes for performance optimization

**Migration Strategy:** All database changes include tested rollback procedures and data integrity validation.

### Transport Modes
Supports both SSE (Server-Sent Events) and stdio transport modes for different MCP client integrations. SSE is recommended for web-based clients, stdio for desktop applications.

## Performance Baseline (Task 1.0 Complete)

**Current Baseline Metrics (2025-06-05):**

# CLAUDE.md - Conversation History

## Latest Session: Code Extraction Logic Improvements - COMPLETED ✅
**Date: 2024-12-19**

### Objective
Fix critical issue with `smart_chunk_markdown` function breaking code blocks and causing extraction failures.

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Problem**: Original `smart_chunk_markdown()` function was breaking BEFORE closing ``` tags
- **Impact**: Created malformed markdown chunks with orphaned opening/closing tags
- **Specific case**: DeepWiki mem0-mcp page with `@mcp.tool` decorator was being mangled

### Issues Fixed
1. ✅ **Code block boundary detection**: Now preserves complete blocks
2. ✅ **Infinite loop bug**: Fixed logic error in chunking progression
3. ✅ **Orphaned tags**: Eliminated incomplete chunks like ````python\n@mcp.tool(\n````
4. ✅ **Empty code blocks**: No more ````\n```\n```` patterns
5. ✅ **Function signature merging**: Fixed `asyncdefadd_coding_preference` type issues

### Implementation Details
- **Created**: `src/improved_chunking.py` with `EnhancedMarkdownChunker` class
- **Enhanced**: Complete code block detection with `find_code_blocks()` method
- **Added**: Safe break point logic that never splits code blocks
- **Implemented**: Chunk validation system with issue detection
- **Fixed**: Critical logic bug where `actual_end <= start` was always true

### Key Technical Improvements
1. **`CodeBlockInfo` class**: Tracks code block boundaries and languages
2. **`find_safe_break_point()` method**: Ensures code blocks are never split
3. **Validation system**: Detects orphaned tags, empty blocks, merged signatures
4. **Drop-in replacement**: Updated `smart_chunk_markdown()` to use enhanced version

### Test Results
- ✅ **Validation**: 0 malformed blocks (vs multiple in original)
- ✅ **Code preservation**: `@mcp.tool` decorator properly maintained in complete Python code block
- ✅ **Performance**: Fixed infinite loop, no performance regressions
- ✅ **Compatibility**: Backward compatible, existing functionality preserved

### Files Modified
- `src/crawl4ai_mcp.py`: Replaced `smart_chunk_markdown()` with enhanced version
- `src/improved_chunking.py`: Complete enhanced chunking implementation
- `TASKS.md`: Marked task as completed with full details

### Verification
- **Test content**: DeepWiki mem0-mcp content properly chunked
- **Code blocks**: All 5 code blocks detected and preserved
- **Integration**: Working correctly with existing crawl pipeline
- **Validation**: 0 issues found in comprehensive validation

### Next Steps
The enhanced chunking is now integrated and working correctly. The system will properly preserve code blocks during crawling, fixing the original issue with code extraction failures.
